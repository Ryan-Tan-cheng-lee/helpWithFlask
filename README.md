# helpWithFlask

Hi i'm doing a small project on flask and socket IO but my android app seems to have some issue connecting.

Flask Server flask 2.2.2, flask Socket IO 5.3.6

Android Studio Code implementation ('io.socket:socket.io-client:2.1.0') 

Button to emit"Function1"

Im running the flask server on my PC and using an android phone to do debugging Both are connected to the same Wifi When the app starts up, nothing is displayed on the server, so does the button press. How can i rectify this?

How do I enable this connection? I am able to use postman to emit and event which is captured on my server
