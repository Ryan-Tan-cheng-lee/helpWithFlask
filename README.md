# helpWithFlask

Hi i'm doing a small project on flask and socket IO but my android app seems to have some issue connecting.

Here are the versions for my python server:
Flask                       2.2.2
Flask-SocketIO              5.2.0
python-socketio             5.7.1
python-engineio             4.3.4
websocket-client            1.3.3
Werkzeug                    2.2.2
gevent                      24.2.1
gevent-websocket            0.10.1

Here is the version for my android studio code

Android Studio Code implementation ('io.socket:socket.io-client:2.1.0') 


Im running the flask server on my PC and using an android phone to do debugging Both are connected to the same Wifi When the app starts up, nothing is displayed on the server, so does the button press. How can i rectify this?

How do I enable this connection? I am able to use postman to emit an event which is captured on my server
